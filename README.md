# koko-fork-agents-observe

Real-time observability dashboard for Claude Code agents.

> **This is a hardened fork of [`simple10/agents-observe`](https://github.com/simple10/agents-observe).**
> Full credit for the original design, dashboard, hook taxonomy, and server architecture goes to [@simple10](https://github.com/simple10) (Joe Johnston).
> This fork only adds security hardening for personal use — see [What this fork changes](#what-this-fork-changes) below.

Includes powerful filtering, searching, and visualization of multi-agent sessions.

## What this fork changes

Three small but security-relevant changes vs upstream. Everything else — the dashboard, the hook taxonomy, the data model, the slash commands — is identical to `simple10/agents-observe`.

| Change | Why |
|---|---|
| Hono server binds `127.0.0.1` by default in local runtime (Docker runtime still binds `0.0.0.0` inside the container so the host port-forward works). Override with `AGENTS_OBSERVE_BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0`. | The upstream default binds the dashboard to every network interface. On shared Wi-Fi or a corporate VPN, anyone on the LAN can read every captured prompt and tool call. |
| `docker run` publishes the container port to `127.0.0.1` instead of the Docker default of `0.0.0.0`. Override with `AGENTS_OBSERVE_DOCKER_PUBLISH_HOST=0.0.0.0`. | Same reason at the Docker layer — even if the server binds to all interfaces inside the container, the host bind controls whether the LAN can reach it. |
| `docker pull` is skipped when the image is already present locally. | Lets you run a locally-built tag like `agents-observe:local` without needing to publish it to a registry. |

The bundled [`Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile) is also hardened vs upstream: `npm ci` instead of `npm install`, a pinned Node base tag, a non-root runtime user (UID 1000 / `node`), `apt --no-install-recommends`, and a `HEALTHCHECK` against `/api/health`. Build locally with `just build`.

If you don't need any of that, use the upstream project. It is the same code minus those changes.

## Quick Start

Install as a `claude code` plugin from this fork:

```bash
# Add this fork as a marketplace
claude plugin marketplace add diegorv/koko-fork-agents-observe

# Install the plugin
claude plugin install koko-fork-agents-observe@koko-fork-agents-observe

# Then just run claude
# The plugin will auto start the MCP server and capture events
claude

# Use the /observe skill in claude to check status, restart the server, etc.
> /observe status
> /observe debug
> /observe logs
> /observe restart

# Open the dashboard UI in a browser
open http://localhost:4981
```

Default dashboard URL: <http://localhost:4981>

### Run with a locally-built image

To avoid pulling a binary image from any registry, build the image locally and point the plugin at it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/diegorv/koko-fork-agents-observe.git
cd koko-fork-agents-observe

just build
# (or: docker build -t agents-observe:local .)

export AGENTS_OBSERVE_DOCKER_IMAGE=agents-observe:local
```

Add the `export` line to your shell profile, or on macOS set it for GUI apps with:

```bash
launchctl setenv AGENTS_OBSERVE_DOCKER_IMAGE agents-observe:local
```

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (required — the server runs as a container)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (required — hook scripts run via `node`)

If docker or node are not installed on your host, the plugin will fail to properly load.

Use the `/observe debug` claude command to help troubleshoot and fix installation issues.

## Plugin Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/observe` | Open the dashboard URL and check if the server is running |
| `/observe status` | Show server health, version, runtime, and config details |
| `/observe start` | Start the server |
| `/observe stop` | Stop the server |
| `/observe restart` | Restart the server |
| `/observe logs` | Show recent Docker container logs |
| `/observe debug` | Diagnose server issues (health, docker logs, mcp.log, cli.log) |

## Why observability matters

When Claude Code runs autonomously — spawning subagents, calling tools, reading files, executing commands — you have no visibility into what's actually happening. The terminal shows a fraction of the activity. Subagents are invisible. Tool calls blur together. And when something goes wrong three agents deep in a parallel execution, you're left reading through logs after the fact.

This project captures every hook event as it happens and streams it to a live dashboard. You see exactly what each agent is doing, which tools it's calling, what files it's touching, and how subagents relate to their parents. In real time.

This matters because:

- **Multi-agent work is opaque.** A coordinator spawns a code reviewer, a test runner, and a documentation agent in parallel. Without observability, you only see the final result. With it, you watch each agent work and catch problems as they happen.
- **Tool calls are the ground truth.** The assistant's text output is a summary. The actual tool calls — the Bash commands, file reads, edits, grep patterns — tell you what Claude is really doing. The dashboard shows you both.
- **Debugging is time travel.** When a subagent makes a bad edit or runs a destructive command, you need to trace back through the exact sequence of events. The event stream gives you that timeline with full payloads.
- **Sessions are ephemeral, but patterns aren't.** By capturing events across sessions, you can see how agents behave over time, which tools they favor, and where they get stuck.

## What you can do

- Watch tool calls stream in as they happen (PreToolUse → PostToolUse with results)
- See the full agent hierarchy — which subagent was spawned by which parent
- Filter by agent, tool type, or search across all events
- Expand any event to see the full payload, command, and result
- Click timeline icons to jump to specific events in the stream
- Browse historical sessions with human-readable names (e.g., "twinkly-hugging-dragon")

## Architecture

```
Claude Code Hooks  →  observe_cli.mjs  →  API Server (SQLite)  →  React Dashboard
  (agent-lib build)     (HTTP POST)        (parse + store)        (WebSocket live)
```

`observe_cli.mjs` reads the raw event from stdin and dispatches to an agent-class-specific lib (`hooks/scripts/lib/agents/<class>.mjs`) whose `buildHookEvent()` constructs the envelope — including agent-class-aware flags like `meta.isNotification` / `meta.clearsNotification` — then POSTs it to the server. The server applies those flags mechanically to its stored state (e.g. `pending_notification_ts`) and forwards events to subscribed WebSocket clients; it stays agent-class-neutral. The React dashboard derives all agent state (status, event counts, timing) from the event stream.

## Standalone Installation

> For development or running without the plugin. If you installed via the plugin above, skip this section.

### 1. Clone and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/diegorv/koko-fork-agents-observe.git
cd koko-fork-agents-observe

# Install just if needed
brew install just

# Start the docker container
just start

# Or start local dev servers
just install
just dev
```

See [justfile](./justfile) for additional commands.

### 2. Configure Claude Code hooks

Copy the hooks from `.claude/settings.json` into your target project's Claude Code settings:

- **Project-level** (recommended): `.claude/settings.json` in your project root
- **User-level** (all projects): `~/.claude/settings.json`

Update the `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` paths to point to your `koko-fork-agents-observe` install location.

**Environment variables set in the config:**

A few commonly used ones:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `AGENTS_OBSERVE_SERVER_PORT` | `4981` | Server port. |
| `AGENTS_OBSERVE_BIND_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` (local) / `0.0.0.0` (docker container) | Server bind address. Set to `0.0.0.0` to expose the dashboard on the LAN. |
| `AGENTS_OBSERVE_DOCKER_PUBLISH_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Host interface the Docker port-forward publishes on. Set to `0.0.0.0` to expose the dashboard on the LAN. |
| `AGENTS_OBSERVE_DOCKER_IMAGE` | `ghcr.io/simple10/agents-observe:v<version>` | Override to use a local build, e.g. `agents-observe:local`, or your own published image. |
| `AGENTS_OBSERVE_NOTIFICATION_ON_EVENTS` | `Notification` | Comma-separated hook events that trigger the bell. Empty string disables bells. |
| `AGENTS_OBSERVE_PROJECT_SLUG` | (auto-detected) | Project slug shown in the dashboard URL. If not set, derived from the session transcript path. |
| `AGENTS_OBSERVE_API_BASE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:4981/api` | Full URL for the events endpoint. |

The env var names are kept identical to upstream so existing configs continue to work. See [`docs/ENVIRONMENT.md`](./docs/ENVIRONMENT.md) for the full list.

### 3. Verify it works

```bash
# Check the server is running
just health

# Send a test event
just test-event
```

Navigate to **<http://localhost:5174>** (dev) or **<http://localhost:4981>** (Docker). You should see the test event appear. Start a Claude Code session in your configured project and events will stream in automatically.

## Standalone Commands

If you have [just](https://github.com/casey/just) installed:

```bash
# Development:
just install          # Install all dependencies
just dev              # Start server + client in dev mode (hot reload)
just test             # Run all tests (server + client)
just test-event       # Send a test event to the server
just fmt              # Format all source files

# Server (Docker):
just build            # Build the hardened Docker image locally
just build   # Build the hardened Docker image locally
just start            # Start the server (same path as plugin MCP)
just stop             # Stop the server
just restart          # Restart the server
just logs             # Follow Docker container logs
just start-local      # Start server locally without Docker

# Utilities:
just health           # Check server health
just db-reset         # Delete the events database
just cli <command>    # Run CLI directly (hook, health, start, stop, restart, logs)
just open             # Open the dashboard in browser
```

```

## How it works

**Hooks** fire on every Claude Code event (tool calls, prompts, stops, subagent lifecycle). `observe_cli.mjs` reads the raw event from stdin and dispatches through `hooks/scripts/lib/agents/<class>.mjs` — each agent class's `buildHookEvent()` builds the envelope (project metadata plus agent-class-aware flags like `meta.isNotification` / `meta.clearsNotification`) and the CLI POSTs it to the server. If the server needs additional data (like the session's human-readable slug), it responds with a request — the hook reads it from the local transcript file and sends it back.

**Server** receives raw events, extracts structural fields (type, tool name, agent ID), stores agent metadata (name, description, type, parentage), and saves everything in SQLite. Events are forwarded to WebSocket clients subscribed to the relevant session — each browser tab only receives events for the session it's viewing. The server tracks session status (active/stopped) but does not track agent status.

**Client** fetches events via REST API on initial load, then receives real-time updates via WebSocket (events are appended to the local cache — no refetching). All agent state (status, event counts, timing) is derived from the event stream. Tool events are deduped client-side (PreToolUse + PostToolUse merged into a single row). The emoji icon mapping and summary generation are editable config files.

### Dev vs Production

In dev mode, the client and server run as separate processes with separate ports.

In production or docker mode, the client is bundled and served by the server. Both the API and dashboard are served from the same process and port.

Both local dev and Docker flows default to using the same sqlite database in `./data`. The database is auto created as needed.

## Troubleshooting

**Docker not running?**

The plugin requires Docker to run the server. Make sure Docker Desktop (or the Docker daemon) is running, then restart Claude Code.

**Port 4981 in use?**

The server auto-assigns a free port if 4981 is taken. To explicitly set a port, add `AGENTS_OBSERVE_SERVER_PORT=<port>` to your environment or `.env` file.

**Plugin not capturing events?**

Run `/observe debug` to diagnose. It checks server health, Docker container logs, MCP logs, and CLI logs. You can also run `/observe status` for a quick health check.

**Events not appearing in the dashboard?**

1. **Is the server running?** Run `just health` to check.
2. **Is the hook script configured?** Copy the hooks from `.claude/settings.json` into your project's settings.
3. **Is `AGENTS_OBSERVE_PROJECT_SLUG` set?** If not set, the project is auto-detected from the session transcript path.
4. **Can the hook reach the server?** Run `just test-event` — if the event appears in the dashboard, the server is reachable.

**WebSocket disconnected?**

The client reconnects automatically every 3 seconds if the WebSocket connection drops. You'll see "Disconnected" in the sidebar footer. Events received during reconnection will appear once the connection is restored and the events are refetched.

**Database issues?**

Run `just db-reset` to delete the SQLite database and start fresh (stops the server, deletes the db, restarts). The database is auto-created on the next server start.
