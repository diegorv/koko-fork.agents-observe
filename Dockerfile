# Hardened production image for koko-fork-agents-observe.
# Differences vs the historical upstream Dockerfile (agents-observe v0.9.6):
#   - Node base tag pinned to a specific patch release (no silent "slim" drift)
#   - `npm ci` instead of `npm install` (lockfile-strict, reproducible)
#   - apt with --no-install-recommends + cache cleaned
#   - Non-root runtime user (UID 1000 / `node`)
#   - HEALTHCHECK against /api/health
#   - Runtime still uses `tsx` (the server sources use extensionless ESM
#     imports which strict node ESM rejects; switching to plain `node` would
#     require rewriting every import).
#
# Build locally:
#   docker build -t agents-observe:local .
#
# Use a locally built image with the plugin:
#   export AGENTS_OBSERVE_DOCKER_IMAGE=agents-observe:local

# When updating Node, verify the new digest of the base image:
#   docker pull node:24.10-slim && docker inspect --format='{{.Id}}' node:24.10-slim
